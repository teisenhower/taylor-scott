### Project Overview

This project is the starting point to a portfolio site for a close photographer friend of mine. She doesn't have an online resource _(other than Facebook and Instagram)_ currently to showcase her work or potentially reach new clients. Her and I have teamed up in order to fix this issue.

This site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) because 1) I honestly enjoy working with Gatbsy and 2) the end goal is to incorporate a headless Wordpress solution using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) so Gatsby seemed like a great choice.

### Design

I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to build out the basic design. If you're interested in viewing that you may [here](https://www.figma.com/file/rJkNYg2cOueRV87dLPPP10/Taylor?node-id=0%3A1). It is not very extensive at this stage. Just enough to get moving. As pages are added, this artboard will surely grow.

### Run Locally

Interested in contributing, learning or just want to tinker around? Here is how you can clone and run this site locally.

> You'll need Git, npm, Node.js and the Gatsby CLI installed. You can follow [this](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-zero/) guide if you need to install any of these dependencies.

```
# Clone repo
git clone git@github.com:teisenhower/taylor-scott.git

# Go in to repo directory
cd taylor-scott

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Once all dependencies have installed launch site locally
gatsby develop
```
